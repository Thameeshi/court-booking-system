# üèüÔ∏è Courtify ‚Äì Decentralized Court Booking System

Courtify is a comprehensive decentralized court booking platform designed to simplify and modernize the management and reservation of sports courts. Built as a second-year Software Development project, Courtify integrates cutting-edge blockchain technology, cloud-based image hosting, and smart contract backends to deliver a trustworthy, transparent, and user-friendly experience for court owners, players, and administrators.

## Overview

The platform empowers court owners to easily create and manage their courts by providing detailed information such as court name, sport type, location, pricing, amenities, and up to three high-quality images per court. These images are securely stored and delivered using **Cloudinary**, ensuring fast loading times and reliable availability.

Court owners can define availability by specifying dates and time slots. Each available slot can be minted as a **non-fungible token (NFT)** on the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)** via **HotPocket smart contracts**, providing tamper-proof proof of booking and increasing trust between court owners and players.

Public users can browse and search courts by location, sport, or price, view real-time availability, book slots, and receive NFTs as immutable proof of their reservations. Users can also cancel bookings, burning the corresponding NFT to trigger refunds, ensuring a seamless and transparent booking experience.

An intelligent **chatbot** guides users and court owners through tasks such as searching courts, booking slots, managing courts, and understanding platform policies, enhancing the overall user experience.
